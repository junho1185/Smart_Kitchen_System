# Smart Kitchen System

This repository stores the software code for the Smart Kitchen System, a mechanical engineering project developed by a team for a course project. The project aims to solve the inconvenience of accessing cooking materials from corner shelves in the kitchen by implementing a rotating shelf with motors under each shelf for automatic rotation. The software side of the product is being developed and maintained by the author of this repository.

## Basic Idea

The Smart Kitchen System is a rotating shelf system with two-story shelves that rotate independently, each equipped with a motor for automatic rotation. The system uses voice recognition technology to convert user speech to text, which is then sent to the ChatGPT API for filtering out the desired item, whether it's a dish or a cooking material like sugar, salt, and pepper. Once the item is identified, the shelf rotates to bring the item closest to the user.

The shelf returns to its initial position once the user is done with the item, and if there are more materials required, the shelf rotates to the next item. The entire process is displayed on a touch-screen for the user's convenience.

## Software Development

As the software developer for this project, my responsibilities include developing the code for voice recognition, motor control, and touch-screen display. The project uses Python programming language for development.
